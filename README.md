# Pig-Game
Pig is a game where players take turns rolling dice.
Traditionally, it's only 2, but this is a variant.

The goal is to have their total score reach a certain # of points.
Players take turns earning points by rolling dice.
Each roll adds that sum onto a round score, which my or may not be added
to their total score, dictated as below:

A person's turn lasts until they want to stop rolling or roll some 1s.

If at any point during the player's turn they roll one 1:
their round ends and their round score is added to their total score.

If they roll two 1s:
they lose all points for the round, and their turn is over.

Three 1s:
they lose all of their points in the game, and their turn is over.

If they're unlucky and recieve the 'luck' of four 1s (four-eyed snake ::S):
they immediately lose the game.

Whenever the player decide to stop their turn, their round points are 
added to their total points.

When a player's total points reach 100 (controllable below), they win.
